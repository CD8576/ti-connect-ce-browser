<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In most schools nowadays, students use chromebooks. These chromebooks are usually locked down so you can't install games and other non-school related stuff. I believe this app should always have been available online the same way it is already for the TI-Nspire™ CX II. (https://nspireconnect.ti.com/nsc/) As a student myself, I found it pretty hard to find a program that works exactly the same as [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) The app most similar to a website was of course the one on the webstore so I went ahead, downloaded it and started patching everything. It works by emulating the environment of a platform app in a browser.

There MAY be some bugs so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
